## 🔧 Development Workflow by teammate Sajan Jwala Ray

1. Cloned the GitHub repository  
2. Created project folder and subfolders: `frontend/` and `backend/`  
3. Added placeholder files using `.gitkeep` to track folders  
4. Made the first commit with folder structure  
5. Created a new development branch `sajan_branch`  
6. Added `index.html` and `main.py` in respective folders  
7. Committed changes with proper message  
8. Switched back to `main` and merged `sajan_branch`  
9. Pushed final merged code to the remote repository

## 🔧 Development Workflow by teammate Deoraj Gope

1. Forked the original repository to my GitHub account
2. Cloned the forked repository locally
3. Created a new branch named `deoraj_branch`
4. Made code changes in index.html file
5. Committed changes
6. Pushed my branch to my forked remote repository
7. Created a Pull Request to the original repository of my teammate for review and merge
8. Pull request merged successfully
