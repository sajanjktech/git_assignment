## ✨ Features

- Practical Git workflow with branching and merging
- Frontend: Basic HTML file to greet user
- Backend: Python script to greet  user
- Clean and organized folder structure
- Git concepts implemented: `.gitkeep`, branching, merging, pushing
- Step-by-step commit history with meaningful messages

---

## 🌿 Branch Structure

- `main` – Main production branch
- `sajan_branch` – Development branch for implementing frontend and backend code

---

## 🔧 Development Workflow

1. Cloned the GitHub repository  
2. Created project folder and subfolders: `frontend/` and `backend/`  
3. Added placeholder files using `.gitkeep` to track folders  
4. Made the first commit with folder structure  
5. Created a new development branch `sajan_branch`  
6. Added `index.html` and `main.py` in respective folders  
7. Committed changes with proper message  
8. Switched back to `main` and merged `sajan_branch`  
9. Pushed final merged code to the remote repository

---

## 🔌 Installation

Clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sajanjktech/git_assignment.git
cd git_assignment
```

## 🧠 What We Learned

- How to create and clone repositories
- Git commands for branch creation and switching
- Workflow of adding, committing, and merging changes
- Creating `.gitkeep` to track empty directories
- Collaborative development using Git
- Pushing and pulling changes from GitHub

**Git commands used:**

- `git clone`
- `git init`

## ✅ Steps Followed

1. Cloned the repository
2. Created folder structure: `Team_MCA/frontend` and `Team_MCA/backend`
3. Added `.gitkeep` files to commit empty folders
4. First commit: Folder structure setup
5. Created a new branch `sajan_branch`
6. Added code files (`index.html`, `main.py`)
7. Committed code files
8. Merged `sajan_branch` into `main`
9. Pushed final version to remote repository
